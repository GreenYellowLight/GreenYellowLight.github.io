    <h1>Frogger</h1>
    <div>
      <h2><strong>How to play:</strong></h2>
      <p> The aim of Frogger is to score the most points. A tally of how many points have been scored this game is kept
        beside the text "Current score". "High score" keeps track of your best game until you reload the page. "Difficulty"
        keeps tracks of the difficulty (which is a multiplier of piece movement speed).
        <br><br>
        <strong>Movement:</strong> You are the frog, the <font color="LimeGreen">light green</font> square at the bottom of the game. 
        w = up, a = left, s = down, d = right.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Scoring:</strong> There are two ways to score in this game. Each is worth 1 point <ol>
          <li>Jump on one of the <font color="DarkGreen">dark green</font> lily pads at the top of the game. Doing so will teleport you back to
            the start. After you jump on all three lily pads they will reset so you can score again!
          </li>
          <li>Touch one of the <font color="GoldenRod">gold</font> coins that will occasionally go across the screen. Be quick as they disappear!</li>
        </ol>
      <strong>Obstacles:</strong> there are two main sections with obstacles that the frog has to be wary of. The road and the river.
      <br><br>
      The road is the first obstacle. It is the  <font color="BlueViolet">purple</font> strip. On the road there are a lot of  <font color="Red">red</font> cars. Cars kill frogs when they touch them!
      When you go accross the road make sure not to touch any cars.

      <br><br>
      The river is the second obstacle. Do not touch the water! Jump from <font color="LimeGreen">green mossy log </font> to
      <font color="LimeGreen">green mossy log</font>. Frogs have bad balance, so if you are partly off a log you will slip and drown!
